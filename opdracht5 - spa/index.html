		<h3>Code Consistency</h3>
		<p>Usage of the same patterns is critical between team members so as to never cause confusion.</p>
		</p>It's worth establishing conventions at the project start or enabling automatic settings in the build or editor environments that might enforce particular rules.</p>

		<h3>Indentation</h3>
		<p>Please consistently indent, nest, include braces, quotes, and new lines so that code is clear and can be read easily. New code that is added should never deviate from existing formatting conventions or change the indent levels.</p>
		<p>For all code languages, we recommend the use soft tabs comprised of four spaces per tab. Hitting the Tab key in your text editor should generate four space characters rather than one tab character. This results in our code appearing identical across platforms.</p>

		<p>If tab stops are favored by a team, simply maintain consistency for a project and it's deliverables so developers can make adjustments to their editing environments a single time.</p>

		<h3>Readability</h3>
		<p>We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code.</h3>

		<p>There is no need to write code in an obfuscated or compressed way for the purpose of file-size savings.</p>
		<p>We will use automated server-side or other build processes to optimize files.</p>
		<p>This includes concatenating files, code minification, gzipping, and setting "Far Future Expires".</p>
		<p>The ability for another developer to read the code is paramount above other concerns, especially if optimization can be handled another way.</p>
