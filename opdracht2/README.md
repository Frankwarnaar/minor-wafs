+ You can do more with writing less code
+ Makes using AJAX easy
+ Has lots of plugins
+ Has a big community
+ Solves crossbrowser issues

# Disadvantages

+ You have to make another request to receive jquery on your page, or your bundled javascript is larger
+ jQuery is used often for animations. CSS animations often are a lot quicker
+ Using jQuery limits your knowlegde of javascript. If you change to another library/framework, you have to start over. It's better to focus on learning vanilla js, as this knowledge is always handy.
