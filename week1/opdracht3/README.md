# Advantages SPA

+ Makes user load sources once, instead of at every page refresh.
+ Lighter for the server, as the client renders the front-end instead of the server when using php or jade.

# Disadvantages

+ First load takes longer than normal. The user might load things he/she is not going to need.
+ Javascript is required
+ Easier to hack, while the user can easily inspect structure of a website.
