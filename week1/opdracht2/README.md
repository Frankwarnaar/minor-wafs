# Advantages jQuery

+ Easy to learn when you have knowledge of css, as it's using css selectors

jQuery uses the sams selectors as css. You just wrap it in $(<css selector>), and it selects a DOM element for you just like css does. This way, it's easier for someone who doesn't have much knowledge of javascript, but with css knowledge.
+ You can do more with writing less code

jQuery has some functions that makes it easy to return DOM elements (like the .parent() function, that returns the parent of an element). In native javascript you would have to write more code to get the same result.
+ Makes using AJAX easy

Ajax is easy to use in jQuery by using the $.ajax() functionality. They also have a good documentation on this. This makes it easy do an AJAX call, without writing that much code.
+ Has lots of plugins

There are loads of plugins for jQuery. So if you want a functionality that is not inside the original jQuery, there probably is a plugin written by somebody else.
+ Has a big community

jQuery is used by a very large community. When you're having a problem you can't solve on your own, the chance is big somebody has already posted the same question you're facing somewhere on the web. Otherwise you can get reactions quickly on your issue.
+ Solves crossbrowser issues

jQuery doesn't depend on new features in javascript. This way you can use a lot of functions without writing fallbacks for old browsers.

# Disadvantages

+ You have to make another request to receive jquery on your page, or your bundled javascript is larger
+ jQuery is used often for animations. CSS animations often are a lot quicker
+ Using jQuery limits your knowlegde of javascript. If you change to another library/framework, you have to start over. It's better to focus on learning vanilla js, as this knowledge is always handy.
+ Using jQuery makes it harder for new developers on your team to get up to speed with your project(s)
